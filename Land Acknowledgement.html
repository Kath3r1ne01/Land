    <p title="I'm a tooltip">Territory acknowledgment</p>

    <p> Before the establishment of Canada, the Stó:lō people, known as the People of the River, inhabited the land where the University of the Fraser Valley (UFV) now stands.<br>
        Their territory spans the Fraser Valley and the lower Fraser Canyon in British Columbia, and their traditional language is Halq'eméylem, the upriver dialect.<br>
        UFV acknowledges and deeply respects the enduring contributions of Indigenous peoples to our community.The university is committed to supporting <br> Indigenous learners and embedding Indigenous perspectives and ways of knowing within its curriculum.</p>
